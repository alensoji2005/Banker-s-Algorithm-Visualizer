Here are 2-3 test cases to check your Banker's Algorithm visualizer.

✅ Test Case 1: Safe State (Standard Example)
This is a classic example that should result in a safe state.

Processes (P): 5

Resources (R): 3

Available Resources (E):

[ 3, 3, 2 ]

Max Demand Matrix (C):

[[7, 5, 3],
 [3, 2, 2],
 [9, 0, 2],
 [2, 2, 2],
 [4, 3, 3]]
Allocation Matrix (A):

[[0, 1, 0],
 [2, 0, 0],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [2, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 2]]


❌ Test Case 2: Unsafe State
This case will lead to a deadlock. No process can have its needs met.

Processes (P): 4

Resources (R): 3

Available Resources (E):

[ 2, 1, 0 ]

Max Demand Matrix (C):

[[8, 4, 3],
 [5, 2, 1],
 [4, 3, 1],
 [6, 3, 2]]
Allocation Matrix (A):

[[3, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1],
 [3, 1, 0]]


✅ Test Case 3: Different Dimensions (Safe)
This tests that the UI and logic work correctly with different numbers of processes and resources.

Processes (P): 4

Resources (R): 2

Available Resources (E):

[ 1, 2 ]

Max Demand Matrix (C):

[[4, 2],
 [2, 3],
 [4, 1],
 [3, 4]]
Allocation Matrix (A):

[[2, 0],
 [1, 2],
 [3, 0],
 [0, 1]]
